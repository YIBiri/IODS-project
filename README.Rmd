This course diary is related to an [Open Data Science MOOC](https://mooc.helsinki.fi/course/view.php?id=158) organized by the University of Helsinki. 

I have heard that this course is a good way to get a quick introduction to R and statistics. I already have a bit of experience in both, but I'd like to learn how to apply them better in my own research. The course contents include many themes I am not too familiar with, so I look forward to learning about them by Christmas!
